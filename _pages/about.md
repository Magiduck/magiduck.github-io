As part of my bachelor in Bioinformatics I am currently doing an minor in Sensor System Engineering at the Hanze Institute of Technology. I think the combinations of Bioinformatics with Sensor System Engineering can give me an unique field of expertise to work on Biosensors.

I study Bioinformatics at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Nijmegen.


My most recent position is Bioinformatics Intern at Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft – Brouns lab.

I have also worked briefly (three months) as a front-end PHP developer at Omnext.


I am inquisitive and want to learn new skills to develop myself. Because of this I like to believe that research suits me. I’m serious on-the-job and fellow students appreciate my contributions in collaborations. I consider my options before I operate and I’m open to receiving feedback. One of the many things I learned during my study is to collaborate with new people I didn’t know beforehand.
