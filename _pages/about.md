I study Bioinformatics at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Nijmegen.

Currently my position is Bioinformatics Intern at Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft – Brouns lab.

I am also going to study Sensor System Engineering because I think the combination of this study with Bioinformatics will be very interesting

I am inquisitive and want to learn new skills to develop myself. Because of this I like to believe that research suits me. I’m serious on-the-job and fellow students appreciate my contributions in collaborations. I consider my options before I operate and I’m open to receiving feedback. One of the many things I learned during my study is to collaborate with new people I didn’t know beforehand.
