I study Bioinformatics at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Nijmegen.

I am currently doing my Bachelor End Project at Naturalis in the analysis of automatic insect data. This project involves the detection and classification of insects with help of deep learning. You can expect more about this in February.

As part of my bachelor in Bioinformatics I did an minor in Sensor System Engineering at the Hanze Institute of Technology.

Before this I was a Bioinformatics Intern at Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft – Brouns lab. Here I developed DAGGER, a tool for the interactive graph-based visualization of genome architecture comparisons.

I have also worked briefly (three months) as a front-end PHP developer at Omnext.

I am inquisitive and want to learn new skills to develop myself. Because of this I like to think that research suits me. I’m serious on-the-job and fellow students appreciate my contributions in collaborations. I consider my options before I operate and I’m open to receiving feedback. One of the many things I learned during my study is to collaborate with new people I didn’t know beforehand.
