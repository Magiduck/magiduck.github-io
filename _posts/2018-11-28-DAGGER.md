## Abstract

#### The variability between genome architectures, the collection of non-random arrangements of functional elements within a genome, can be used to determine the similarities and differences in a genome comparison to study genome evolution. Long-read sequencing brings the benefit of a more accurate assembly in regions of the genome with repetitive sequences and complex structural variation. Long-reads can be more easily aligned to each other which leads to more accurate comparisons of genome architectures. Instead of aligning sequences, a single graph-based data structure can offer more information of similarities and differences in genome architecture in variable regions. Ptolemy is a tool that is able to compare genome architectures without the need of a reference in a gene graph with vertices representing genes. The interpretation of these gene graphs can however be difficult without visualization, and currently few tools provide biological depth when representing these graphs. In this study we present Directed Acyclic Graphs for GEnomic readability (DAGGER), a tool with a graphical user interface for the interactive visualization of gene graphs from GFA1-formatted files. We show the features of DAGGER by visualizing the genome architecture comparison of three novel Escherichia phages (most closely related to vB_EcoM_AYO145A) in a single gene graph using Ptolemy. We also present the stand-alone tool POET (Ptolemy Output Enhancement Tool). This tool can be used for the further analysis of genome graph data generated by Ptolemy. With help of Ptolemy and POET we partially analyse the genome architecture of a dataset of long-sequencing reads of a chimeric generated bacteriophage of E. coli bacteria BL21phi10. Finally, we present a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of different layout algorithms to visualize gene graphs.
